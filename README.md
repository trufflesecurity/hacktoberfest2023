There are two categories for the Detector Competiton: _adding new detectors_ (1 point) and _fixing broken detectors_ (2 points). Each _merged_ PR with a `Hacktoberfest-Detector-Competition-New` or `Hacktoberfest-Detector-Competition-Fix` will be awarded 1 or 2 points, respectively.

### Broken Detectors (label: `Hacktoberfest-Detector-Competition-Fix` 2 points): 
Below are some examples of fixes that will be considered. Make sure to supply ample evidence of the fix in the PR description. 
- Correct the verification logic to accurately check detected secrets against the respective APIs.
- Improve or correct the regular expressions used for secret detection.
- Implement new or missing authentication methods for API verification.


### New Detectors (label: `Hacktoberfest-Detector-Competition-New` 1 point):

Submit a PR for a Detector you think would be valuable. Please follow the "Adding Detectors" contributing guidelines [here](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/blob/main/hack/docs/Adding_Detectors_external.md). In the new detector PR please provide documentation and supporting evidence for the validity of the detector's regular expressions. 

### Getting Started
- Fork the TruffleHog Repository.
- Pick an issue labeled Hacktoberfest or create one that you'd like to work on.
- Commit and push your changes.
- Create a Pull Request.

- Wait for a review.


### Competition Rules and Notes
- Start date for submissions: Sept 30.
- End date for submissions: Oct 31.
- Any submissions received after Oct 31 will be ineligible for the Detector Competition.
- New Detectors must be for valid credential providers. There is no benefit to the community for adding a Detector when the credential provider has no users. PRs that add invalid Detectors will be labled `invalid`.
- Spam PRs will be marked with a `spam` label and closed. Contributors with 2+ spammy PRs are disqualified.
- Contributors who attempt to duplicate other contributors PRs will be disqualified (aka, don't go hunting on GitHub for TruffleHog forks).
- Each week we will be posting the scoreboard to the Hacktoberfest channel in the Secret Scanning Discord and on [this github issue](TOD)
