ü•á 1st Prize: MacBook Air

ü•à 2nd Prize: Backpack

ü•â 3rd Prize: Custom TruffleHog Swag

There are two categories for the Detector Competiton: _adding new detectors_ (1 point) and _fixing broken detectors_ (2 points). Each _merged_ PR with a `Hacktoberfest-Detector-Competition-New` or `Hacktoberfest-Detector-Competition-Fix` will be awarded 1 or 2 points, respectively.

### Broken Detectors (label: `Hacktoberfest-Detector-Competition-Fix` 2 points):
Below are some examples of fixes that will be considered. Make sure to supply ample evidence of the fix in the PR description.
- Correct the verification logic to accurately check detected secrets against the respective APIs.
- Improve or correct the regular expressions used for secret detection.
- Implement new or missing authentication methods for API verification.


### New Detectors (label: `Hacktoberfest-Detector-Competition-New` 1 point):

Submit a PR for a Detector you think would be valuable. Please follow the "Adding Detectors" contributing guidelines [here](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/blob/main/hack/docs/Adding_Detectors_external.md). In the new detector PR please provide documentation and supporting evidence for the validity of the detector's regular expressions.

### Getting Started
- Fork the TruffleHog Repository.
- Pick an issue labeled Hacktoberfest or create one that you'd like to work on.
- Commit and push your changes.
- Create a Pull Request.
- Sign the CLA.
- Wait for a review.


### Competition Rules and Notes
- Start date for submissions: Sept 30.
- End date for submissions: Oct 31.
- Any submissions received after Oct 31 will be ineligible for the Detector Competition.
- New Detectors must be for valid credential providers. There is no benefit to the community for adding a Detector when the credential provider has no users. PRs that add invalid Detectors will be labled `invalid`.
- Spam PRs will be marked with a `spam` label and closed. Contributors with 2+ spammy PRs are disqualified.
- Contributors who attempt to duplicate other contributors PRs will be disqualified (aka, don't go hunting on GitHub for TruffleHog forks).
- Each week we will be posting the scoreboard to the Hacktoberfest channel in the Secret Scanning Discord and on [this github issue](TODO)
- Find a list of Active Detectors being worked on [this github issue](TODO)
- This competition is _first come first serve_. If multiple PRs for the _same_ Detector or Detector fix are opened, only the first one opened will be awarded points if merged.
    - However, if we request changes in a PR and that PR is abandoned (aka, no activity within 3 days), then we will consider new contributions.
- If you want your PRs to be excluded from the competition all you have to do is ensure that you don't apply the `Hacktoberfest-Detector-Competition-New/Fix` label.
- To avoid folks cheesing the competition, we have a few criteria that must be met for a _new_ Detector to be considered:
    - The detector provider must show up on a Google search.
    - TODO

## General Contributions
We're also participating in the larget "Hacktoberfest" program sponsored by Digital Ocean. To maintain the integrity of TruffleHog, we're looking for meaningful contributions that align with the project's goals. Here are the types of contributions that are eligible:
- Issues Labeled ‚ÄúHacktoberfest‚Äù: We have a backlog of issues and some of them have been labeled ‚ÄúHacktoberfest‚Äù.
- Expanding our Test Coverage: Add new tests or expand existing tests to increase our test coverage to make TruffleHog even more robust!


### TODO
Pin issue that will do two things:
1. Keep a tally of points
2. Open/working on Detector types
