ü•á 1st Prize: MacBook Air

ü•à 2nd Prize: Backpack

ü•â 3rd Prize: Custom TruffleHog Swag

There are two categories for the Detector Competiton: _adding new detectors_ (1 point) and _fixing broken detectors_ (2 points). Each _merged_ PR with a `Hacktoberfest-Detector-Competition-New` or `Hacktoberfest-Detector-Competition-Fix` will be awarded 1 or 2 points, respectively.

### Broken Detectors (label: `Hacktoberfest-Detector-Competition-Fix` 2 points):
Below are some examples of fixes that will be considered. Make sure to supply ample evidence of the fix in the PR description.
- Correct the verification logic to accurately check detected secrets against the respective APIs.
- Correct the regular expressions used for secret detection.


### New Detectors (label: `Hacktoberfest-Detector-Competition-New` 1 point):

Submit a PR for a Detector you think would be valuable. Please follow the "Adding Detectors" contributing guidelines [here](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/blob/main/hack/docs/Adding_Detectors_external.md). In the new detector PR please provide documentation and supporting evidence for the validity of the detector's regular expressions.

### Competition Rules and Notes
- Start date for submissions: Sept 30.
- End date for submissions: Oct 31.
- Any submissions received after Oct 31 will be ineligible for the Detector Competition.
- New Detectors must be for valid credential providers. There is no benefit to the community for adding a Detector when the credential provider has no users. PRs that add invalid Detectors will be labeled `invalid`.
- Spam PRs will be marked with a `spam` label and closed. Contributors with 2+ spammy PRs are disqualified.
- Each week we will be posting the scoreboard to [this github issue](TODO)
- This competition is _first come first serve_. If multiple PRs for the _same_ Detector or Detector fix are opened, only the first one opened will be awarded points if merged.
    - However, if we request changes in a PR and that PR is abandoned (aka, no activity within 3 days), then we will consider new contributions.
- If you want your PRs to be excluded from the competition all you have to do is ensure that you don't apply the `Hacktoberfest-Detector-Competition-New/Fix` label.
- To avoid folks gaming the competition, we have a few criteria that must be met for a _new_ Detector to be considered. See the Detector Criteria section below.
- The final tally will be determined once all competition PRs submitted before November 1 are either merged or closed.


### Detector Criteria

#### 1. Documentation:
- **Provide screenshots or log outputs of passing tests**. This includes a local test of the detector _actually_ recieving a 2xx (i.e, proving verification). See the notes on testing [here](TODO)
- Provide steps on how to create an account and generate credential for the provider.
- Provide supporting evidence for the validity of the Detector's regular expressions.
- If possibile, cite official documentation or recognized community resources to justify the regex patterns used.
- **Make sure to redact any sensitive information**!

#### 2. Relevance:
- *Category*: The Detector should fall under one of the recognized categories such as:
  - Payment Processors (e.g., Stripe, PayPal, Square)
  - DevOps Tools (e.g., Jenkins, CircleCI, Travis CI)
  - Security Tooling (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Fortify)
  - Infrastructure Platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP)
  - AI & Data Products (e.g., TensorFlow, Jupyter, AWS Sagemaker)
  - Collaboration & Communication (e.g., Slack, Trello, Zoom)
  - Databases (e.g, Supabase, MongoDB)
  - CSM (e.g, HubSpot, Zendesk)
- If a Detector doesn't fit into one of these categories but you believe it's crucial, provide a compelling case for its inclusion.

#### 3. User Base & Popularity:
- The credential provider the Detector is targeting should have a healthy and active user base.
- Consider using metrics like:
  - Monthly active users.
  - GitHub stars (if it's an open-source tool).
  - Presence in industry reports or articles.

- Fork the TruffleHog Repository.
